# Colin's PCB Introduction

This repo contains [Colin O'Flynn](www.oflynn.com)'s presentation on PCB design. Despite the name this wasn't
designed as a very in-depth presentation, instead it was a single class lecture given at Dalhousie University
to the 2025 ECED3901 (Design II) students so they had some background in PCB design.

However - I thought other people may find this useful, especially to ~~steal~~ reuse the slides in their own
class or presentation. While there are lots of great videos and similar out there, often you need the slides
for giving the talk yourself and that was harder to find. Plus I wanted to cover a few of my own topics!

## Project

In ECED3901 there is a project, where they design an inductive driver PCB (motor or electromaget type thing). The goal
is to learn about higher current considerations (temperature rises) as well as some basics of selecting parts,
matching footprints, and similar.

The final video above covers a few more details of that project, but it also includes another example of selecting a part (MOSFET) and matching the KiCad footprint. That part of the video is most valuable if you're getting started I suspect!

## PPTX Usage

Note the PPTX includes 3 videos. They are *not* embedded in the file to reduce the file size (in case of changes). You may wish to embed them, but if not make sure you have the 3 files in the directory, and I think it will find them.

## License

The slides are CC-SA licensed. It's up to you to decide if all images etc can be presented in your environment. The videos are my own and CC-SA as well.
